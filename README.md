# ImmersiveLearning

The *Immersive Learning* project is one of the many projects being conducted within the Ambient Lab at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
This is the second attempt to create the *Immersive Learning* project. The previous attempt was in 2016 and ended with a simple working version of the project, but the work is now inaccessible.

## Objective

The goal of the Immersive Learning project is to create a platform that enhances the learning experience for students by immersing them in the material using virtual 3D objects. The HoloLens will allow us to use augmented reality (AR) to display virtual objects over the real world without completely obstructing it. Implementing this technology in a classroom, physical or online, can allow students to observe and interact with objects that represent images or diagrams seen on videos or presentation slides during the lesson.
